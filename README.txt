The purpose of this project was simple, extract currency data from a website in order to build a database.At the time of the creation of this project the team I am working on uses static currency files that would otherwise have to be linked with Vlookups in Excel.I figured if we could combine our international transactional data with a dynamic database that can average by month based on a daily aggregation method we'd have a constant data source as well as a useful currency tracker. The infomration used during this process is applied to separate proprietary processes that can't be shared.This is because companies take this type of stuff very seriously, nevertheless this portion of the project was an idea I'd be trying to hatch in my spare time in order to monitor currencies and oil for personal projects of mine, it's now useful for some work projects too.
